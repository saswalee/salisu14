<center><h3>The Lion and the Rabbit</h3></center>

<p>Once there was a Lion in the jungle who used to kill 2-3 animals daily for his meal.
 All animals went to him to tell, that daily one of them will come to him for his meal.</p>
 
 <p> So, the Lion agreed and this started going for many days. One day,
 it was Rabbit's turn. When he was on his way he saw a well.
Now he plans to kill the lion and save himself. He went to lion and told him that, 
there is another lion who claims to be more powerful than him.</p>

<p>Then lion asks the rabbit to take him to that lion. The rabbit takes him to
 the well and said he lives here. When the lion looked in the well he saw his own 
 reflection and jumped in the well and
dies.</p>
